# Sudoku
Scala Sudoku backtracking solver

I used SBT to build my Scala projects. This file is from the src/main/scala folder. My favorite portion of this code are the two lines that create the Sudoku board and the possible entries in each square. I think it's a good use of some of Scala's map, zip, toList, and filter functions.
